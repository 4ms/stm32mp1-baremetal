* I2C controller embedded in STMicroelectronics STM32 I2C platform

Required properties :
- compatible : Must be one of the following
  - "st,stm32f4-i2c"
  - "st,stm32f7-i2c"
- reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts : Must contain the interrupt id for I2C event and then the
  interrupt id for I2C error.
  Optionnaly a wakeup interrupt may be specified.
- resets: Must contain the phandle to the reset controller.
- clocks: Must contain the input clock of the I2C instance.
- A pinctrl state named "default" must be defined to set pins in mode of
  operation for I2C transfer. An optional pinctrl state named "sleep" has to
  be defined as well as to put I2C in low power mode in suspend mode.
- #address-cells = <1>;
- #size-cells = <0>;

Optional properties :
- clock-frequency : Desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz. If not specified,
  the default 100 kHz frequency will be used.
  For STM32F4 SoC Standard-mode and Fast-mode are supported, possible values are
  100000 and 400000.
  For STM32F7, STM32H7 and STM32MP1 SoCs, Standard-mode, Fast-mode and Fast-mode
  Plus are supported, possible values are 100000, 400000 and 1000000.
- i2c-scl-rising-time-ns: I2C SCL Rising time for the board (default: 25)
  For STM32F7, STM32H7 and STM32MP1 only.
- i2c-scl-falling-time-ns: I2C SCL Falling time for the board (default: 10)
  For STM32F7, STM32H7 and STM32MP1 only.
  I2C Timings are derived from these 2 values
- st,syscfg-fmp: Use to set Fast Mode Plus bit within SYSCFG when Fast Mode
  Plus speed is selected by slave.
	1st cell : phandle to syscfg
	2nd cell : register offset within SYSCFG
	3rd cell : register bitmask for FMP bit
  For STM32F7, STM32H7 and STM32MP1 only.
- st,syscfg-fmp-clr: Use to clear Fast Mode Plus bit within SYSCFG when Fast
  Mode Plus speed is selected by slave.
	1st cell: phandle to syscfg
	2nd cell: clear register offset within SYSCFG
	3rd cell: register bitmask for FMP clear bit
  For STM32MP1 family only.

* I2C Devices

An I2C device connected onto STM32 I2C controller must use a format described by
i2c.txt file.

Required properties :
- compatible
	Device driver compatible name
- reg
	I2C slave addresses (see i2c.txt for more details)

Optional properties :

	i2c@40013000 {
		camera@3c {
			compatible = "ovti,ov5640";
			reg = <0x3c>;
		};
	};
