MikroTik CRS305-1G-4S+IN
========================

CRS305-1G-4S+IN is a 4x SFP+ switch with a Gigabit Ethernet port for management.
Specifications:
 - Marvell Prestera 98DX3236 switch with an integrated ARMv7 CPU
 - 512 MB DDR3 RAM
 - UART @ 115200bps
 - 4x SFP+
 - Gigabit Ethernet (AR8033)
 - 16 MB SPI flash (Winbond 25Q128JVSM)

Currently supported hardware:
 - UART boot (using kwboot) and console
 - SPI boot, environment and load kernel

Planned:
 - Gigabit Ethernet support

Getting binary.0
================
binary.0 (DDR3 init phase) can be retrieved/extracted from the integrated bootloader on the SPI flash.
Then binary.0 can be replaced with the extracted blob.
