    pci: Correct cast for sandbox
    
    This gives a warning with some native compilers:
    
    cmd/pci.c:152:11: warning: format ‘%llx’ expects argument of type
       ‘long long unsigned int’, but argument 3 has type
       ‘u64 {aka long unsigned int}’ [-Wformat=]
    
    Fix it with a cast.
