# Contributing guide

This document serves as a checklist before contributing to this repository. It includes links to read up on if topics are unclear to you.

This guide mainly focuses on the proper use of Git.

## 1. Issues

STM32MPU projects do not activate "Github issues" feature for the time being. If you need to report an issue or question about this project deliverables, you can report them using [ ST Support Center ](https://my.st.com/ols#/ols/newrequest)  or  [ ST Community MPU Forum ](https://community.st.com/s/topic/0TO0X0000003u2AWAQ/stm32-mpus).

## 2. Pull Requests

STMicrolectronics is happy to receive contributions from the community, based on an initial Contributor License Agreement (CLA) procedure.

* If you are an individual writing original source code and you are sure **you own the intellectual property**, then you need to sign an Individual CLA (https://cla.st.com).
* If you work for a company that wants also to allow you to contribute with your work, your company needs to provide a Corporate CLA (https://cla.st.com) mentioning your GitHub account name.
* If you are not sure that a CLA (Individual or Corporate) has been signed for your GitHub account you can check here (https://cla.st.com).

Please note that:
* The Corporate CLA will always take precedence over the Individual CLA.
* One CLA submission is sufficient, for any project proposed by STMicroelectronics.

__How to proceed__

* We recommend to fork the project in your GitHub account to further develop your contribution. Please use the latest commit version.
* Please, submit one Pull Request for one new feature or proposal. This will ease the analysis and final merge if accepted.

__Note__

Merge will not be done directly in GitHub but it will need first to follow internal integration process before public deliver in a standard release. The Pull request will stay open until it is merged and delivered.
