* Texas Instruments - dp83867 Giga bit ethernet phy

Required properties:
	- reg - The ID number for the phy, usually a small integer
	- ti,rx-internal-delay - RGMII Recieve Clock Delay - see dt-bindings/net/ti-dp83867.h
		for applicable values
	- ti,tx-internal-delay - RGMII Transmit Clock Delay - see dt-bindings/net/ti-dp83867.h
		for applicable values
	- ti,fifo-depth - Transmitt FIFO depth- see dt-bindings/net/ti-dp83867.h
		for applicable values
	- enet-phy-lane-swap - Indicates that PHY will swap the TX/RX lanes to
		compensate for the board being designed with the lanes swapped.
	- enet-phy-no-lane-swap - Indicates that PHY will disable swap of the
		TX/RX lanes.
	- ti,clk-output-sel - Muxing option for CLK_OUT pin.  See dt-bindings/net/ti-dp83867.h
			      for applicable values.  The CLK_OUT pin can also
			      be disabled by this property.  When omitted, the
			      PHY's default will be left as is.

Default child nodes are standard Ethernet PHY device
nodes as described in doc/devicetree/bindings/net/ethernet.txt

Example:

	ethernet-phy@0 {
		reg = <0>;
		ti,rx-internal-delay = <DP83867_RGMIIDCTL_2_25_NS>;
		ti,tx-internal-delay = <DP83867_RGMIIDCTL_2_75_NS>;
		ti,fifo-depth = <DP83867_PHYCR_FIFO_DEPTH_4_B_NIB>;
		enet-phy-lane-no-swap;
		ti,clk-output-sel = <DP83867_CLK_O_SEL_CHN_A_TCLK>;
	};
